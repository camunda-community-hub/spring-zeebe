This project allows to leverage Zeebe within your Spring or Spring Boot environment easily. It is basically a wrapper around the [Zeebe Java Client](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/product-manuals/clients/java-client/index).


## Add Spring Boot Starter to Your Project

Just add the following Maven dependency to your Spring Boot Starter project:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>io.camunda</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-zeebe-starter</artifactId>
	<version>${CURRENT_VERSION}</version>
</dependency>
```

# How to use

## Connect to Zeebe Broker

Just add the `@EnableZeebeClient` annotation to your Spring Boot Application:

```
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableZeebeClient
public class MySpringBootApplication {
```

Now you can inject the ZeebeClient and work with it, e.g. to create new workflow instances:

```
@Autowired
private ZeebeClient client;
```

## Deploy Process Models

Use the `@ZeebeDeployment` annotation:

```
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableZeebeClient
@ZeebeDeployment(resources = "classpath:demoProcess.bpmn")
public class MySpringBootApplication {
```

This annotation uses (which internally uses [https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#resources-resourceloader](the Spring resource loader) mechanism which is pretty powerful and can for example also deploy multiple files at once:

```
@ZeebeDeployment(resources = {"classpath:demoProcess.bpmn" , "classpath:demoProcess2.bpmn"})
```
or define wildcard patterns:
```
@ZeebeDeployment(resources = "classpath*:/bpmn/**/*.bpmn")
```

## Implement Job Worker

```
@ZeebeWorker(type = "foo")
public void handleJobFoo(final JobClient client, final ActivatedJob job) {
  // do whatever you need to do
  client.newCompleteCommand(job.getKey()) 
     .variables("{\"fooResult\": 1}")
     .send()
     .exceptionally( throwable -> { throw new RuntimeException("Could not complete job " + job, throwable); });
}
```

## Configuring Camunda Cloud Connection

Connections to the Camunda Cloud can be easily configured:

```
zeebe.client.cloud.clusterId=xxx
zeebe.client.cloud.clientId=xxx
zeebe.client.cloud.clientSecret=xxx
zeebe.client.cloud.region=bru-2
```

If you don't connect to the Camunda Cloud production environment you might have to also adjust these two properties:

```
zeebe.client.cloud.baseUrl=zeebe.camunda.io
zeebe.client.cloud.port=443
zeebe.client.cloud.authUrl=https://login.cloud.camunda.io/oauth/token
```

As an alternative you can use the [Zeebe Client environment variables](https://docs.zeebe.io/operations/authorization.html#environment-variables). 

## Configuring Self-managed Zeebe Connection

```
zeebe.client.broker.gateway-address=127.0.0.1:26500
zeebe.client.security.plaintext=true
```

## Additional Configuration Options

If you build a worker that only serves one thing, it might also be handy to define the worker job type globally - and not in the annotation:

```
zeebe.client.worker.defaultType=foo
```

Number of jobs that are polled from the broker to be worked on in this client and thread pool size to handle the jobs:

```
zeebe.client.worker.maxJobsActive=32
zeebe.client.worker.threads=1
```

For a full set of configuration options please see [ZeebeClientConfigurationProperties.java](client/spring-zeebe-starter/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/spring/client/config/ZeebeClientStarterAutoConfiguration.java)

## ObjectMapper customization
If you need to customize the ObjectMapper that the Zeebe client uses to work with variables, you can declare a bean with type `io.camunda.zeebe.client.api.JsonMapper` like this:
```java
@Configuration
class MyConfiguration {
  @Bean
  public JsonMapper jsonMapper() {
    new ZeebeObjectMapper().enable(DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_EMPTY_ARRAY_AS_NULL_OBJECT);
  }
}
```
