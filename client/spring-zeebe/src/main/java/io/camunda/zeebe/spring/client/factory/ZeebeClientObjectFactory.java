 * Factory to create a new ZeebeClient.

 *
 * In normal applications, the @EnableZeebeClient annotation pulls in {@link ZeebeClientSpringConfiguration}, which provides a ZeebeClientObjectFactory based on the normal ZeebeClientBuilder configured by Spring properties
 *
 * In testing, the ZeebeTestClientSpringConfiguration provides the ZeebeClientObjectFactory by providing the ZeebeClient obtained from the ZeebeTestEngine.
